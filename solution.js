// My Solution:

//    Declare a variable named str and assign a string as its value. Make sure the string is at least 6 characters long. Print the variable to the console.

  str = "Rami Rami";
console.log(str);
//  Access the 2nd and 6th elements of the string using index notation. Print the elements to the console.
console.log(str[1], str[5]);

  //  Declare a variable called firstName and assign a string as its value.
firstName = "Rami";
//    Declare a variable called age and assign a number as its value.
age=36;
 //   Declare a variable called year and assign a number as its value.
year = 2022;
//    Using your declared variables, print a string to the console. For example, "Basem is 37 in 2020".
console.log(firstName, "is", age, "in", 2020);
//    Declare a variable called isMarried and assign it a boolean value.
isMarried = false;
//    Print a string to the console, indicating whether or not your person is married. For example, "Basem is married: true"
console.log(firstName, "is married:", isMarried);
//    Declare a variable called programmingLanguage and assign "JavaScript" as its value. Declare a variable called isFun and give it a value of true
//. Print "JavaScript is fun: true" to the console, using your declared variables.
programmingLanguage = "Javascript";
isFun = true;
console.log("JavaScript is fun:", isFun);
//    Print the J and S of "JavaScript" from the variable programmingLanguage to the console.
console.log(programmingLanguage[0], programmingLanguage[1]);
// Print the length of the string "JavaScript" to the console.
console.log(programmingLanguage.length);
